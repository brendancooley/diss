# Why War?

**War's Consequences**

- Direct: lives lost, property destroyed, productive resources reallocated
- Indirect: wars confer political powers on victors
  + Today's global governance institutions established and propagated by World War II victors (Ikenberry 2011)
- Costs of anarchy (Fearon 2018)
  + Military expenditure: 2.2 percent world GDP (2019, [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion))

--

**The Bargaining Model**

&gt; Most conflict situations are essentially *bargaining* situations
&gt;
&gt;  -- Thomas Schelling, *The Strategy of Conflict*

- War results from bargaining frictions (Fearon 1995):
  + Variation in war's propensity explained by variation in magnitude of bargaining frictions (power shifts and information asymmetries)
- Some *conflict of interest* assumed by the model
  + Little attention paid to where conflicts of interest come from, variation in intensity across dyads

# What is the bargaining and fighting *about*?

---

# The "Pie": Territory?

**A Representative Formulation**

&gt; Consider a situation where two states are involved in a dispute...

--

&gt; We conceptualize the conflict as occuring over a divisible item of unit size, **such as an area of territory or an allocation of resources**.

--

&gt;  -- Fey and Ramsay 2011

--

**Governments as Territory-Maximizers?**

- 1945-Present: Territorial disputes are rare and circumscribed in their extent (Schultz and Goemans 2019)
- 1914-1945: Allied victors of world wars decline to seize territory of their wartime enemies
- 1815-1914: Imperial conquest and spheres of influence common, colonial powers often refrain from directly exploiting colonies' land
  + British in India, treaty ports in Qing China, Perry expeditions, Japan and Russia in Manchuria

--

**Then why war and conquest?**

class: inverse

**An Alternative Account**

&gt; Historically, great power competition has been driven primarily by exclusion or fears  of exclusion from each power's **international economic zone,** including its domestic markets. 

--

&gt; Great powers in the past have often used their international influence to build zones in which **subordinate polities** -- whether these be colonies or simply states within a sphere of influence -- **are integrated into their economies.**

--

&gt; These economic zones, in turn, are typically biased in favor of the great power's firms and investors, with the effect of **excluding (in whole or part) the economic agents of other great powers.**

# **Theory** and **Evidence** on Economic Openness and Coercive Diplomacy

---

# Theory

**Conflicts of Interest: Commercial Policy and its Economic Effects**

- Firm lobbying produces **mercantilist** governments, seeking
  + protectionism at home
  + trade openness abroad
- Market access externality: protectionism **shifts profit opportunities** from foreign to home firms (Ossa 2012)
  + Trade policy generates conflicts of interest between mercantilist governments

--

**Bargaining in Anarchy**

- Efforts to pursue market openness abroad can take the form of **threats, displays, and uses of military force**
- Peacetime institutions facilitating economic subordination: **empires, hegemonies, hierarchies**
  + Supported by implicit threat of force
  
---

# Paper I

.center[**Gunboat Diplomacy: Political Bias, Trade Policy, and War**]

- Actors: Two governments
  + *Liberal* governments value welfare of consumers
  + *Illiberal* governments value firm profits
- Interactions
  + Government 1: makes take-it-or-leave-it offer (pair of tariffs) to government 2
  + Government 2: accept or declare war

--

**Incentives**

- War and Regime Change
  + War fought to impose liberal "puppet" abroad that implements free trade
- Market access increases profits for home firms

--

**Result I:** Liberal governments less likely to fight wars

--

**Result II:** Powerful governments adopt higher tariffs than weaker counterparts

# Microfoundations of international conflict: influence of politically-connected, export-oriented firms on "security" policy

&gt; Since trade ignores national boundaries and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market, the flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nations which are closed must be battered down
&gt;
&gt; -- Woodrow Wilson, 1907 (Williams, *The Tragedy of American Diplomacy*)

# Evidence?

.center[**Coercion's effects on the international economy**]

**Measurement:** Quantifying trade policy

- Aggregate magnitude of policy-induced trade distortions, margins of preferential access

**Inference:** Power vs. Preferences

- What trade policies would governments' adopt in the absence of coercion?

---

# Paper II

.center[**Estimating Policy Barriers to Trade**]

**Varieties of Trade Barriers**

- Direct: tariffs, quotas, price controls, health and safety regulations, technical barriers to trade
- Indirect: government procurement rules, firm subsidies, excise taxes, domestic regulations

--

**Model**

- Trade flows, cross-national price levels, and freight costs are sufficient statistics for aggregate magnitude of policy barriers to trade

--

**Results**

- Policy induced barriers to trade an **order of magnitude larger than tariffs**
- Developed countries enjoy superior market access conditions abroad

---

# Paper III

.center[**Trade Policy in the Shadow of Power: Quantifying Military Coercion in the International System**]

- `\(N\)`-government extension of "gunboats"
- Costs of war depend on observable dyadic features
  + Military expenditure ratio
  + Geographic distance
- Equilibrium trade policies depend on governments' preferences and costs of coercion

--

**Estimation:** Estimate model on observed government trade policies, measured in Paper II

--

**Results:**

- Returns to military advantage
- No geographic loss of strength gradient

--

**Counterfactual: A Coercion-Free World**

- Coercion increases value of global trade by 60 percent

class: middle, inverse

# Conclusions

**International Security Studies**

- Taking conflicts of interest seriously 
  + Variation in trade policy orientation drives foreign policy behavior
  + War propensity and incentives for military expenditure depend on foreign and domestic trade policy preferences

**International Political Economy**

- Constraints of anarchy and trade policy
  + Trade openness a function of domestic preferences and foreign coercion
  + Observed trade policies are not a sufficient statistics for underlying trade preferences

&gt; The relationship between economics and politics...is a reciprocal one. On the one hand, politics largely determines the framework of economic activity and channels it in directions intended to serve the interests of dominant groups; &lt;br /&gt; the exercise of power in all its forms is a major determinant of the nature of an economic system. On the other hand, the economic process itself tends to redistribute power and wealth; it transforms the power relationships among groups.
